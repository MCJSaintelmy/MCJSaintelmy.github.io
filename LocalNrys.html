        <p>Buying locally-grown trees, including choose-and-cut trees, supports family-owned farms and businesses, preserves farmland, improves the local economy, and protects the environment.
Our locally owned garden centers also offer customers a more enriching shopping experience. Each is unique in some way. A top reason to buy from local nurseries and garden centers, is the quality of the plant material is better maintained and better suited to the local environment.

           <p>"Just Fruits began as a small retail nursery in 1978, founded by Brandy Cowley-Gilbert & her father, affectionately known as “The Old Hippie.” At that time we were called “Just Fruits Nursery” and only consisted of edible plants. The motto was: “If you can’t eat it, we don’t need it! As Just Fruits continued to grow, we became not only a nursery for the southeast, but one for all across the US." </p>
