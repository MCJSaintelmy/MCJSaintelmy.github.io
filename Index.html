     	   From Jesus's birth in a wooden manger to his death on the cross, the life of the Messiah is inseparable from trees. The entire New Testament is filled with roots, fruits, soils, branches, vines, and seeds. From the opening words of Matthew's gospel describing Jesus's family tree to Revelations closing image of the tree of life at the center of heaven, we encounter a forest of trees.

      <h1 class="subtitle"> How we grow </h1>
        <h3>Trusting Jesus: The True <em>Gardener</em>.</h3>
          <p>Days spent seeking frist the kingdom of God, are days that shall not soon be regretted. Behold, the church is Christ's Eden, watered by the river of life, and so fertilized that all manner of fruits are brought forth unto God; and he, our second Adam, walks in this spiritual Eden to dress it and to keep it.
           </p>
       
          <P class="howwe1">Consider the Parable of the sower."<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013&version=NKJV" target="_blank">A farmer went out to sow a seed..</a>"; One can dive into who the "farmer" was, in comparison to ourselves; or the fact that he "went out", when trying to understand the purpose of the body . But lets focus on the seeds, what it took to get one to grow; the end results of that growth. A parable laid out by the gardener to help us all to grow, for us to yield a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.
          </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Soil</li>
            </ul>
              <p>Soil is the source of all life. Soil provides nutrients that sustain plants for food and energy, and anchors their roots. Likewise, just as important is what, and whom you choose to believe. Without a solid foundation of truth, you already don't have a good start.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Roots</li>
            </ul>
              <p>Roots provide the anchor needed to keep a plant in place. More importantly, roots are the lifeline of a plant, taking up air, water, and nutrients from the soil and moving them up into the leaves. Once we find the truth, the living truth; we need to dig in. With holding nothing; letting your life come from it. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Environment</li>
            </ul>
              <p>Full sun is the ideal environment for most fruit trees; a reflection to our relationship with the Son. As mindful as we should be for the ideal environment; we to should be of the "thorny" environments in our lives. Anything that will choke and stifile our fruit trees, in it's process of growing. "There, in the Garden of Gethsemane, alone, when death loomed near and his friends were close at hand but far away, Jesus prayed".  </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Water</li>
             </ul>
               <p>Plants need water to germinate. Water is needed to activate the process of germination, it also softens the seed making it easier for the plant to break through. Think "Living Water", which you can ask for through prayer and constant communication with God.</P>
            <ul>
              <li>Pruning</li>        
            </ul>
              <p>Proper pruning encourages strong growth, increases flower and fruit production, improves plant health, and removes damaged limbs, all which give aesthetic appeal to a tree. Pruning at the right time and in the right way is critical, since it is possible to kill a healthy tree through neglect or over-pruning. What more need be said? Proper fasting; surrendering; and removal of ungodly things. </P>

           It's not a coincidence that the tree of Life was placed at the center of the garden. The Lord God further illustrating the need to keep himself, truth, and Jesus at the center of everything. It's clear, no matter what was happening in the garden, there was life at the center.

      <h1 class="subtitle">Bearing fruit in your season</h1> 

       <p class="bearfruit1">Seasonal fruits are those that nature offers us according to the time of year . The cold of winter increases our need to strengthen the immune system. That is why many of the fruits whose season is winter provide us with large amounts of vitamin C. 
       </p>

       <p class="bearfruit2">As amazingly as the above fact demonstrate the hand of God in nature; so too, does it show the hand of God in your new spiritual walk.
          We too are to bare seasonal fruit. That does not mean to have apples on your tree all year long; rather, to be of service, to demonstrate your usefulness to the body, even when the apples have all been picked clean. Can someone sit under your branches for shade? Can your leaves be use for medicine? Can your lambs bare someone's weight? We all have the capacity to bare different fruit for different people, in different seasons of our           lives. 
       </p>
       <p class="bearfruit3">
         God is always trying to teach humans to think long-term.  Trees can live as long as 10,000 years. Living just three score and ten years, we get blinded by short-term gain and lose sight of eternity. God wants us to see the forest and the trees. Think like a tree. They give, and they keep giving. They give life and beauty. They give shade and rest. They clean the air. They hold back erosion. They offer shelter, food, and protection.

	Three days after Jesus was crucified and buried, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb to pay her respects. The tomb was empty. With her eyes burning from crying for days, Mary turned and saw Jesus. But she did not recognize him. She thought he was the <em><strong>gardener </strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+20%3A+14-16&version=NKJV" target="_blank"><strong>John 20:14-16</strong></a>. This was no mistake. Jesus is the gardener. The one who plants the seed, who waters it, and helps it to grow. He is the river in the desert; a voice calling out through the dry seasons of our lives. Today, if you hear his voice, raise your lambs; plant your roots in the truth of his word; turn you leaves to the son, and soak in his love. He has the rays of life, he prunes, so he can heal, and his healing is ethernal life.
