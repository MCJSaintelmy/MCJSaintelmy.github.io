    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>

  <h1>Fossil records</h1>
   <p>Other lion subspecies or sister species to the modern lion existed in prehistoric times:
     P. l. sinhaleyus was a fossil carnassial excavated in Sri Lanka, which was attributed to a lion. It is thought to have become extinct around 39,000 years ago.
   P. leo fossilis was larger than the modern lion and lived in the Middle Pleistocene. Bone fragments were excavated in caves in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Czech Republic.</p>

<h2>Hybrids</h2>
<p> Further information: Panthera hybrid
In zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids for the curiosity of visitors or for scientific purpose.[40][41] The liger is bigger than a lion and a tiger, whereas most tigons are relatively small compared to their parents because of reciprocal gene effects.[42][43] The leopon is a hybrid between a lion and leopard.[44]</p>

  <h3>Historical range</h3>
   <p>In Africa, the range of the lion originally spanned most of the central African rainforest zone and the Sahara desert.[74] In the 1960s, it became extinct in North Africa, except in the southern part of Sudan.[75][73][76]

In southern Europe and Asia, the lion once ranged in regions where climatic conditions supported an abundance of prey.[77] In Greece, it was common as reported by Herodotus in 480 BC; it was considered rare by 300 BC and extirpated by AD 100.[45] It was present in the Caucasus until the 10th century.[50] It lived in Palestine until the Middle Ages, and in Southwest Asia until the late 19th century. By the late 19th century, it had been extirpated in most of Turkey.[78] The last live lion in Iran was sighted in 1942 about 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Dezful,[79] although the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the Karun river in Khūzestān Province in 1944.[80] It once ranged from Sind and Punjab in Pakistan to Bengal and the Narmada River in central India.</p>
